# Placement_Prep
## IT company requirements (&#x1F4D6;) :
Here's a broad breakdown that I feel(based on past interview expreiences available on various plateforms) are required for successful preparation for placements. I'll discuss each section in detail later:
- **Communication skills** -> how you speak in the interview
- **Presentation skills** -> how you explain your previous work
- **General Aptitude** -> aptitude tests and your approach in interview
- **Coding skills** -> the way you code
- **Data structure and Algorithm** -> Most Important
- **Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)** -> Important, typically asked in coding interviews
- **Operating Systems** -> asked in 20% tests and in 30% interviews
- **Database Management Systems** -> asked in 20% tests and in 30% interviews
- **Computer Networks** -> asked in 10% tests and in 20% interviews
- **Basic Unix Commands** -> asked in less than 5% tests and in interviews
- **Basic System Design** -> OPTIONAL 
  <br><br>
**One key thing I would like to emphasize here is that having a good understanding of Data Dtructures and Algorithms is very important but may not be sufficient for some companies like Uber, Codenation, Alphonse among others. These companies also look for your coding style, which I'll disucss later in this doc.**
## C++ STL
Since, I used cpp, here are some of the links that will help you train DSA in cpp. Also, I've added a link to my template which I used to use as a base to any problem I used to solve. It has pre-defined macros and basic functions that are used in most of the problems, so it can be used to save time.
